/// \brief The common variables class.
///
/// CCommon is a singleton class that encapsulates things that are common to
/// different game components, including game state variables. Making it a
/// singleton class means that we can avoid passing its member variables
/// around as parameters, which makes the code minisculely faster, and more
/// importantly, makes the code more readable by reducing function clutter.
